*Brogue* is a single-player strategy game set in the halls of a mysterious
and randomly-generated dungeon. The objective is simple enough -- retrieve the
fabled Amulet of Yendor from the 26th level -- but the dungeon is riddled with
danger. Horrifying creatures and devious, trap-ridden terrain await. Yet it is
also riddled with weapons, potions, and artifacts of forgotten power. Survival
demands strength and cunning in equal measure as you descend, making the most
of what the dungeon gives you. You will make sacrifices, narrow escapes,
and maybe even some friends along the way -- but will you be one of the
lucky few to return alive?

### What is kBrogue?

Brogue was created by Brian Walker. Brogue: Community Edition,
is a continuation of its development lead by Temewett, which 
kBrogue branches off from.


Main Goals of kBrogue
-----
While the community edition focuses on fixing bugs/crashes,
quality of life improvements, etc. My goal for kBrogue is 
to add additional content and expiremental changes.

This includes:
- new monsters
- more room/puzzle machines
- new biomes
- new gameplay mechanics
- Quality of Life improvements that I personally enjoy that
     might not be the best option for the Community Edition


Overall I still want to maintain the vanilla feel of Brogue
while still being able to suprise the player with new content
on various playthroughs. More of the things I want to add you
should not encounter on your first run, rather have the player
discover this content across multiple playthroughs.
