----Swapping Tilesets----

First, rename the files "tiles.bin" & "tiles.png" to something that you will remember them as for later. (I just do "original.bin" & original.png respectively)
Move these files into the "Additional Tilesetss" folder.

Then rename the tileset you want to use in the "Additional Tilesets" folder to "tiles.png" & "tiles.bin" and move them into the assets folder, and you're good to go!




----Making Your Own Tileset----

To make a tileset, first make a copy of tiles.png to edit however you would like. The restrictions for tiles are as follows:

Single Tile 
    Width: 128 px
    Height: 232 px
Total Size
    Width: 2048 px
    Height 5568 px

You can use microsoft paint or any other photo editing software and change the tiles to whatever you'd like. When you have your .png edited,
simply rename the files in your assets file "tiles.bin" & tiles.png" to something else (like "original.bin" & original.png") and move them into your 
"Additional Tilesets" folder. Then rename your .png file to "tiles.png" and move it into "Assets" and run Brogue! It should have a new screen pop up 
where you'll see your tiles displayed one by one. After it goes through all your tiles, Brogue will launch with your new tiles ready in game! It will
also have generated a new "tiles.bin" file that should be used only with your specific .png.
